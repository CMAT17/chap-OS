MP3.1
====================
-Exception handlers are not firing during any intentional faults
    -Resolved: IDT entries were not setup in the correct order

-Interrupts do not fire
    -Resolved: enable_irq() had wrong bitshift direction

MP3.2
====================
-Filesystem directory read does not work as intended, gives garbage data
    -Resolved: traversal of data blocks was going out of bounds

-Keyboard should not print buffer unless enter is pressed
    -Resolved: Changed implementation to function according to TA's spec
    
MP3.3
====================
-Execute does not function properly, does not properly context switch
    -Resolved: 
        -Supervisor bit was improperly set
        -Entry point was obtained wrong


-Execute does not function properly, does not return to previous process correctly
    -Resolved:
        -Execute and Halt were obtaining the wrong tss.esp0
            -grabbing from parent process's esp0 instead of current process's esp0
        -Execute and Halt were obtaining the wrong PCB address
            -fixed the math to obtain the correct address

-Halt does not return 256 after exception, causes compiler warning
    -Resolved: 
        -order of operands for cmpl in inline assembly was wrong
        -clobber list was wrong


MP3.4
====================
-File_read causes buffer overflow
    -Resolved: 
        -removed usage of strlen() on non-null-terminated filename
        -refactored read_data

-Executing "cat rtc" after "fish" does not wait before returning to shell
    -Resolved: RTC was not reverting frequency back to default, resulting in extremely frequen interrupts

-Executing any command >20 times generates a triple fault
    -Resolved:
        - Side effect of implementation of re-execution of shell after exit at process id 0
            -fixed by re-executing shell in halt instead

-Keyboard driver stutters, randomly double types and drops keys
    -Resolved:
        -removed cli()/sti() sandwiches around enable/disable_irq for rtc and keyboard
        -adjusted inb statement before check if a key was pressed to otherwise only be executed once.

MP3.5
====================
-Terminals video memory not mapping correctly
    -Outstanding Issue
-Terminals process halting does not follow order of execution per terminal
    -Outstanding Issue
-Scheduler not integrated into OS
    -Outstanding Issue, No time to fix
